## Summary {#summary}

This is my notebook as I go through this paper.

Original article
: [ 2110.06674  Truthful AI: Developing and governing AI that does not lie](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06674)


Truth
: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth>

I have not yet read the paper, but this page will serve as my notes for it.

## Initial thoughts {#initial-thoughts}

An institution, even a benevolent one, reminds
me of The Ministry of Truth from 1984. An
institution is better than anarchy, in my
opinion, but I still think that decentralised
governance, such as from a blockchain is a
better algorithm. Perhaps the Future of Life
Institute could create such a benevolent
blockchain for the dissemination of power over
what is true.


## Benefits of truthful AI {#benefits-of-truthful-ai}

-   people who believe AI-produced statements will avoid being deceived. This could avert some of the most concerning possible AI-facilitated catastrophes.
-   enables justified trust in AI-produced statements (if people cannot reliably distinguish truths and falsehoods, disbelieving falsehoods will also mean disbelieving truths).


## Truthfulness standards {#truthfulness-standards}

-   Domain specific truthfulness standards

There are a few different dimensions on which standards can vary:

-   A standard can be higher or lower. A high standard is more demanding and requires a greater minimum level of truthfulness.
-   A standard can be more or less widely adhered to, within the domain where it applies.
-   Failure to comply with a standard can result in different kinds of sanctions, either formal (e.g. specified in law) or informal (e.g. as a result of social norms).


## Types of truth {#types-of-truth}

This is a work-in-progress.

| Types          | Mentioned   | Other Possible candidates              |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Correspondence |             |                                        |
| Coherence      |             | Language model                         |
| Pragmatic      |             | Interrogating language model           |
| Constructivist | Institution | Blockchain for training data accretion |
| Consensus      |             | Blockchain for trained models          |
| Deflationary   |             |                                        |
| Performative   |             |                                        |


### No mention of blockchain {#no-mention-of-blockchain}

Here are my previous notes on base-truth via language models on the blockchain.
